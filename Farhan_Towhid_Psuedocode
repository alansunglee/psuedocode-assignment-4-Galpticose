We will be creating code to show the instructions for a game that is played with cards.

This game only allows two people to play

Get a deck of cards consisting of 52 cards

Divide the cards into 2 piles consisting 1 card each, and 2 piles consisting of 5 cards each, and 2 piles of 20 cards each. 

Place each pile consisting of 1 card next to each other in the center of the table face down.

Place the 2 piles consisting of 5 cards on either side of the middle 2 piles face down. Make sure these piles are symetrical.

Remove 5 cards from each pile of 20 and hand them to each player face down.

Place each pile of 15 cards below either one of the piles of 5 cards in the center of the table face down.
	1 of each of these piles belong to 1 of the players.

Both players must flip the card in the center of the table over at the same time.

Each player can now look at their hand of 5 cards.

If a player has any cards that can go in either ascending or descending order based on either of the middle piles;
	Said player will place all of the cards that they can on top of the middle pile that their card(s) correspond to.
		If the player has placed any cards;
		Then the player will get a new card from their pile of 15 cards.

Else they must wait for an opportunity where they can perfom said action based on any new cards that the opponent places on the middle pile

If both players are unable to place any cards based on the middle piles;

Then they will draw a card from the "side" piles and will place them face up on top of the middle piles at the same time

The players will continue performing said actions until one of the players runs out of cards to play.
